This project took as a baseline the models from the MindAffect repository (https://mindaffect-bci.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

This is a headband that allows for EEG real-time recording and is designed to be used along with the Oculus Quest Pro headset for XR interaction.
The models do not include the EEG recording kit, for which we used the reduced version of the Gelfree Electrode cap from OpenBCI (https://docs.openbci.com/AddOns/Headwear/GelfreeElectrodeCap/). Although this supports 16 electrodes, we used only the Cyton board since the headband needs accepts only 7 electrodes maximum.

The position of the electrodes was kept with a distance 4 cm measured from the center of the circle to the next one. Their use concerns the visual cortex and thus its used is intended towards Evoked Potentials with responses from visual input (i.e. P300).
